The final section presents a discussion of our methodology for building the digital project. We begin by outlining the decisions made in building our textual corpora, the Life Histories Data Set. We make explicit our decisions regarding metadata such as gender and race. We then turn to the design principles inherent in our mapping process, form aesthetic decisions such as color pallets through technical decisions about technologies would be best able to visualize the data. Finally, we document the text analysis methods used throughout Layer 4.
