# Layer 3: Placing the Life Histories

Layer 3 begins our turn to an analysis of the politics of representation of the SLHP.  While Layer 1 and 2 were dominated by the archival material that charts the early history of the Southern Life History Project appearing, the focus of Layer 3 is on investigating the mapping visualizations to show the ways in which these life histories were ensconced in stories of place—a distinctly Southern space that Couch believed would help a national readership re-imagine southern laborers as perceptive about their conditions, hard working, and shaped by the past as well as the present rather than defined by stereotypes of the region as uneducated, lazy, and backwards.

Reading the life histories through a spatial context allows users to see which geographic areas received the greatest representation. Interviews were conducted in states such as Alabama, South Carolina, and Virginia showing a concerted effort to document across the American South. The emphasis on southeastern states also reveals the continued importance of and process of regional identity construction. Couch sought to use these place-based stories to challenge stereotypes of the region as socially and culturally regressive in order to position the South as a productive contributor to American society and therefore a benefit to the nation. Simultaneously, they reified regionalism by constructing the South geographically as the southeastern states from Louisiana to Alabama and North Carolina to Florida showing national identity and regional particularities could be mutually reinforcing.

At the same time, the cluster of interviews in North Carolina reveals the centrality the coastal state played in the documentary record.  Data analysis reveals that North Carolina constituted nearly 50% of the collection. It is not necessarily unexpected that the Chapel Hill, North Carolina based project would lend itself toward an emphasis on the communities in a close proximity. Given the regional aspirations of the regional aspirations though such an emphasis is surprising. Here we turn to the archival record to discuss Couch’s struggles to convince other states to participate and their reservations. We then turn to why the interviewers  visited small towns and rural areas surrounding metropolitan centers, suggesting Couch’s desire to raise the status of the rural South and the laborers within what he saw as an exploitative systems such as mill work and tenant-farming. Efforts to elevate the rural south came at a time of great anxiety that industrialization and migration were destroying local rural culture, which long had been imagined as central to national identity. The life histories sought to show how rural life was foundational to American social life and identity rather than as communities that were economically and socially behind the times. While such an effort could have been the Agrarians dream, life histories were not designed to romanticize agrarian labor but rather demonstrated the ways that the tenant farming system exploited  laborers  and served as a critique of industrial capitalism.

The layer concludes by looking at how interviewers engaged with interviewees. Labeled by scholars as the “documentary decade”, the 1930s was a period in which cultural workers experimented with forms of documentary representation. As Farm Security Administration photographers such as Dorothea Lange pointed her camera at migrant farmers, life history writers such as Bernice Harris wrote the stories of tenant farmers. Unlike their photography counterparts, SLHP writers encounters far exceeded the seconds it took adjust the F-stop and to snap a camera shutter. Rather, they spent hours in people's homes chronicling their interviewees lived experiences. Writers were given seven page instruction packet that tasked them with describing the living conditions of the interviewees as well the character of the interviewee such that the stories would be “photographic in accuracy”. At the same time, the instructions consistently demanded authenticity be maintained by making the sure the stories were, a Couch stated, “simply told—where characters speak for themselves, with small assistance from the interviewer”. These seemingly contradictory instructions combined with varying skill and proclivity for genres as well the prejudices of the writers created uneven texts that give as much and likely more insight into the subjectivity of the writers than the content of the story. This section draws on scholars of the ethnographic and documentary encounter such as Judith Butler and Robert Coles to explain how the encounter was an active, real-time negotiation that was shaped and reshaped by the positionality and subjectivity of the interviewer and interviewee.

While seldom acknowledged, women were in fact central to the project. At a time when women were often relegated to the domestic sphere, the SLHP employed over ten women who set out across the South to record people’s stories. Their employment was not only a part of a shift in labor practices that would accelerate during World War II but aligned with the ideals, albeit rarely fully realized, of New Deal liberalism. The interviewers sought women’s stories guaranteeing representation in the documentary record and therefore inclusion into the national documentary record. Women discussed a range of themes such as domestic life and labor. Because of their gendered positionality, they also had unique access as women spoke with a level of candor reserved for those who they perceived shared a similar experience and sensibility. As a result, interviewees broached issues such as domestic abuse and prostitution offering a rare glimpse into taboo topics that shaped women’s daily lives, often as societal open secrets but culturally silenced. Moreover, this same positionality perceived as less threatening also resulted in women writers being sent to interviewee others in marginalized positions including African Americans and immigrant classes still read as “not quite white” (cite how irish became white book”). As a result the vast majority of the life histories were written by women. While the SLHP offered some possibilities for new writers to enter the workforce, others were foreclosed. The SLHP hiring of exclusively white women, which reified segregationist economic practices, meant people of color and particularly women of color would be marginalized.
