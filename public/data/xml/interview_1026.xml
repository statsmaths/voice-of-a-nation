<p>Florida.</p>
<p>Rose Shepherd, Writer.</p>
<p>William A. Platt.</p>
<p>Rev. M. Blackford, Director of Keystone Home for Boys, said: A quarter of a mile down to the Jackson store on Lord, then turn to the right and down the little like in the third ne so you�ll find him - a relief of the past, but with a with a  as  as one fifty years younger.�</p>
<p>�The third house� is a well kept cottage with a hospitable front porch having several rockers, the air filled with the fragrance from the -apple tree in full bloom by the goto.  a trellis  right side of the walk from the lane, and a figtree to the left.</p>
<p>A knock on the door brought Mrs. Platt. Who replied in answer to our inquiry. �Yes, he is attending to the chickens. Come in and I�ll him, I know he�ll be anxious to give you his life history and tell about �Keystone.��</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was back. With Mr. Platt - a small sized  looking, his light hair and  moustache, his  gray eyes showing his English lineage. He was dressed in a blue denim suit, with a black sweater, with a dark cap pulled well down on his head.</p>
<p>�I was born in Liverpool, England on October 15, 1855, and same with my father and mother to married in 1873. We landed in  Island  we lived for three years. We suffered terribly from the cold. You know that section on the United States is much colder that English where there is only about 17 degrees difference in the of winter and summer, the summer temperature ranging are  78 degrees. My mother suffered terribly from the extreme cold, and kindly developed a bad case of rheumatism.</p>
<p>�One day in a Woonsocket, Rhode Island newspaper I read an article about Florida, its warm climate affording a haven for these  to scope from the cold. We made immediate plans to leave, and on February 10, 1876 we landed in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>�My father and I were bricklayers. We found a brickyard at St. Nicholas which had been abandoned. We bought it, started morning brick from the clay in the vicinity, and burning it in the old-  way late hard and glazed bricks. We found plenty of outlet for our material right in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>�About this time the Florida East Coast was developing in Florida and the line from South Jacksonville to the Beach was established. I secured the contract for and built a pavilion for the Railroad terminus at the Beach.</p>
<p>�In the meantime, Mr. Harry Packer, whose father was a stockholder of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. of Philadelphia, came to this section and caught the estate  the road here (Keystone), which I know as the Stowe place, for a hunting preserve. He built the house  is use there - with the high gable and �gingerbread work� around  and porches. This was in 1878. On one of his annual trips down here, a  years later, he contracted pneumonia and died in the house there.</p>
<p>�In closing out the estate of Mr. Packer, the property was sold to  Mary Packer, his sister, of Mauchunk, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Miss Packer was middle-aged, but a short time after she same into passion of the place, she met and married a Mr. Cummings about three years her senior. Mr. Cummings, for some of other, always sized to appear younger that his wife, dressing in d and always trying to attract attention.</p>
<p>�Mrs. Cummings was very  and a devout Episcopalian. Mrs.  a secretary. A Mr. Pearsall, who attended to many of the details of her investments, for she inherited a vast fortune. Mr. Pearsall�s son was through Jacksonville last  and  me up, and we  a fine visit. He is now  steamship Line which has headquarters in the West Indies.</p>
<p>Mr. Cummings was a Canadian, and met a man of wealth: his  consisted of a small fishing camp on one of the Thousand  in the St. Lawrence, River, at the time  Miss packer.</p>
<p>She gave him large sums of money, however, and he because known as a developer of suburban electric railways. I remember  him tell of one of his contracts for planning a railway through a section around Flushing, New York. There was vehement objection by the residents on account of the noise it would cause, but he had secured  of-way, and one Sunday when all the villagers  in church, he  his building crew run the rails through the  and in a short time the suburban train was in action. He was  business man, leaving an ostim at 600,000  he died at the age of 79.</p>
<p>Mr. Cummings had heard of my work on the brick pavilion at the Beach (Pablo, it was called then). So one day he cent for me to do  estate which had been christened �Keystone� by Mrs. Cummings her native State - Pennsylvania, always known as the �Keystone State� in the Union.</p>
<p>�I built some flues and chimneys  repaired,  also built the brick ice-house and potato bin under the hill to the left of the road as you drive in.</p>
<p>�Mr. Cummings  with my work, and when I fin he said: �Platt, where I came from, when a  finishes our job, he taken on another. How would you like to work for Mr.  the carpenter foreman here?�</p>
<p>�I replied, �I know nothing about carpentering.�</p>
<p>�That makes no difference � you�ll learn.�</p>
<p>We, the next morning I started laying floors under Mr. Herne�s directions.</p>
<p>�That night Mr. Cummings came around, and he asked: �Horne, what kind of a carpenter did Platt make?�</p>
<p>�Isn�t he a carpenter?� said Mr. Herne, �I did not know he was not a first class  he sure does all right.�</p>
<p>�Well, I did my best, and in 1889 Mr. Cummings said to me , �how would you like to come here and manage this place. You  yourself a house right there by the gate.�</p>
<p> that was my beginning as superintendent for the Cummings� .</p>
<p>The estate before the stones family had it had belonged to the Buckman�s, who had a sawmill there on the river. It was destroyed during the War between the States, and a Federal fort was battery on the  bank, where a huge battery was erected.</p>
<p> the bluff all over using some of the slabs from the  bulk. The old Stowe home on the point was also  during the war with all its contents. It was a father large story and a half house.</p>
<p>�The Stowe title came from the Christopher�s, the family of which Mr. thur Christopher, of Jacksonville, . The Christopher�s were owners of  plantation taking in this whole section known as �St. Joseph Plantation.� They had 300 slaves.</p>
<p>�During the boom, Mr. Charles C. Strickland and his associates changed to name to �San Jose,� but it was known in the �St. Joseph,� and �St. Joe.�</p>
<p>�Mr. Cummings was high tempered, dictatorial, and very hard to  along with. He was always in a fuse with one of the servants. I remember one incident of a colored servant, a girl he  stolen some insignificant thing, and he routed her out and made  the place at 11 o�clock at night.</p>
<p>�Mr. Cummings was a fine woman, always calm and self-possessed  under the most trying circumstances.</p>
<p>�I built all the houses at �Keystone,� and kept the  ready  in repair. My salary to start was &amp;65.00 per month, and there were we old man on the place who were paid &amp;5.00 per week each.  always lived there, one said he had  on the place,  lived to be 105 years of ages the other died at 87.</p>
<p>� Mr. Cummings me, I told him I did not known  farming, and he said: �It will not be so much a matter of farming, it�s mostly bookkeeping, � I started in, and with the we old man, looked after the large orange grave and gardens. There much danger of fire, we kept the forested part raked  and did not  wood to  the  open and the .</p>
<p>greve was a fine asset. In the season of 1893 we  8,000 boxes. There were also trees and fig trees, but there fruits, as well as the garden production of ables, were  homes  them. There were large  at �Keystone� and it took a number of servants to carpenter the house. During the fruit asking  always had on tree, sometimes white, and at other times colored help.  also.</p>
<p>� the winter of 1894 there was a heavy freeze and we lost all the , and in 1895  freeze that killed the trees. It was two years afterwards be  they came up from the foots. I budded these sapling to Satsuma�s, and the tree there  are the result of this culture. We had frequent  the same as now, but only these two hard freezes.</p>
<p>�Mr. Cummings had frequent quarrels with the , and  one of these with Mr. Armstrong who had the  last estate on the south, he built the  building within  rest of property line, so that he would get the fall benefit of the noise from the bowling alleys and the card games, which sometimes were quite hilarious and lasted far into the night. He also built a high  partition fence, entirely obstructing the Armstrong�s view of the beautiful St. Johns and the river traffic.</p>
<p>�Finally, Mrs. Cummings, could no longer stand bad temper and  cities, and there was a separation after -five years of  life. In this settlement she gave him $20,000 to release all slaves on �Keystone,� and thus it passed into her hands again as sole owner.</p>
<p>�Immediately Mrs. Cummings raised by wages to $70.00 per month, and I  as superintendent until her death at the age of 73. Her body was taken back to Mauchunk, Pennsylvania, where she was buried,  funeral being held from the  church there which she had . She willed �Keystone� to St. John�s Parish.</p>
<p> New York  picked up his personal belongings, mostly Japanese trash, and we  saw him again.</p>
<p>�Mrs. Cummings was fond of children, and the place was always open to parting and week-end visits by the younger set of St. Johns Parish. They would climb the big tree, dance, swim in the pool, and play tennis.</p>
<p>�There are many distinguished visitors also. I remember particularly the Reverend Mr. and Mrs. Van Winder Shields and their family  and stayed some time after the big fire of 1901, in which they had lost all their possessions.</p>
<p>Judge Van Valkenburu  the adjoining place, which was  by a nephew, a Mr. Vorhees. He sold it to the Armstrong family. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong died on the same day of, a few hours apart, and were buried on the same day and in the same grave in old Evergreen Cemetery. They had no children. They always had young people about them, and adopted one, a Miss Butler, who was a niece. In the settlement of the estate, the place was purchased by Mr. St. lme (Chick) Acosta twenty-eight years ago. He used it first as a summer home, but has lived there continuously for the past twelve years. I did the brickwork in that old house also.</p>
<p>�You�ll have to excuse me now, I have to go and give my  some  stuff.�</p>
<p>It was  dark now, and I allowed him through the mostly  to the back-yard chicken pans. There were  white leghorns, and Mr. Platt was busy throwing  refused and  of  a finishing touch to their farming feed.</p>
<p> �Forty-nine hens and  forty-six eggs. I�ll here to check up tomorrow, there are three  out , �he </p>
<p>�No, I vote? Yes, ma�am. When I first had to Jacksonville in the early 1870�s, it was still in the  period. There were only two white men in the City government, one, a Welshman, was the mayor and the other was the chief of police. All the others were negroes. The population contained 5,000 negroes, and  the same number of white persons.</p>
<p>�When I was twenty-one, I was allowed to vote, although a had only received my first naturalization papers, and I voted on those papers for thirteen years, As affairs were in such a  then, I was afraid to say anything, and made me effort to get�s final papers until later.</p>
<p>�In , during the boom, I said the brickyard , and  the money to purchase this place of live acres and build my home, he lived here since.</p>
<p>�My four children, two boys and a girl, were all reared at �keystone.� One youngest daughter was carried five years age to an Episcopalian Rector in Philadelphia.  are all scattered, all I have done , and all are good American citizens. My wife and I were done.  are happy, and enjoy cur little home here. For sixty-two years I have spent my life within a radius of two miles, with �keystone� as the hub.</p>
<p>�Yes, I remember Villa Alexander, as well as Mrs. Alexander Mitchell and her charity, and also her lavish entered . There was same misunderstanding between her and Mr. Mitchell, and they were separated. He never care to Jacksonville. Their son, John L. Mitchell, of , was a United States senator that . He also had a bank in Milwaukee. It was the failure of his bank, in which the Mitchell fortune was involved.</p>
