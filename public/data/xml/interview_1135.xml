<p>Charlotte Chapter</p>
<p>Of</p>
<p>The Woman 's Club of the Greek Church.</p>
<p>Following the example of many of the other women of Charlotte, being in accord with their ideals in religious observanceses and with an earnest desire to share with them in the many programs for civic and social betterment, the Greek women organized in 1926 their own woman's Club which is in reality an auxiliary of the Greek Church.</p>
<p>At present their membership numbers thirty, all being married, with American born wives of Greek men receiving equal benefits as the native Greek women.</p>
<p>Though closely associated with the Church and sponsoring many programs of a religious nature, the Club is earnestly interested in all civic projects, social service enterprises, and charities of a personal and city-wide scope, and meets twice a month to transact much business.</p>
<p>In order to have a share in the support of their Church, they sponsor bountiful suppers, also entertainments of various kinds at which they act as chaperones for the young people.</p>
<p>More and more each year the Woman's Club of the Greek Church is making its influence felt in the life of the city.</p>
<p>Their society is an auxiliary in thought, word and deed.</p>
