<p>July 21, 1969</p>
<p>Mrs. Charles O. LeNoir, Secretary,</p>
<p>Jacksonville  Club,</p>
<p>361 Riverside Ave,</p>
<p>Jacksonville, Florida,</p>
<p>Rose Shepherd, “riter.</p>
<p>VILLA ALEXANDRIA, MRS. ALEXANDER MITCHELL.</p>
<p>SOUTH JACKSONVILLE, (Additional).</p>
<p>Continuing, Mrs. LeNoir said: "David Mitchell was most loyal at all times his grandmother. I remember one evening after he and  Patriot were married, she had dressed to go out to dinner at one of the Jacksonville hotels. David refused to accompany her. Angered, she ask why, ‘I have another engagement, he said. ‘What is sure important than accompanying to this dinner. You know I can't go alone,’ said Kittie. 'I have an engagement with my grandmother.’ ‘How long have you had this engagement?’ asked Kittie. ‘Twenty-two years,’ replied David. ‘My grandmother and I had an agreement when she first assumed my  that whenever she needed so I would or if she were lonooamo and Wished me to stay with her, would spend as long as she liked in companionship - just she and I. This is one of those times she has asked me to stay with her for the evening, and I am bound to go on my honor.’ So Mrs. Kittie had to stay quietly at home by herself.</p>
<p>“During the Spanish-American War, when the troops were encamped in Jacksonville, another grandson -- John Mitchell, David’s half-brother, son of his father by the second wife -- was a lieutenant in one of the Wisconsin regiments, and Mrs. Mitchell gave a grand party at Villa Alexandria for the young people of Jacksonville, and I was invited. This John Mitchell seemed to be a very fine young man, serious, and businesslike. This was father of General Mitchell, aviation champion.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Alexander Mitchell was a life-long Episcopalian, and through the efforts of some of the residents of the Southside, a chapel was established as an adjunct to St. Johns Church of Jacksonville, My mother was one of the first ones to project this venture; others were Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, Judge Call and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. DeLacy. Later Mrs. Mitchell became interested and worked heart and soul for the little church, operated first as a Mission - All Saints – and it was hard work for the parishioners to keep Mrs. Mitchell from feeling that she practically owned it, as she gave the organ, the furniture, the vestments, and wanted to do everything that was needed without question and without price.</p>
<p>"The first services were held, in 1835 in the little waiting room at the Ferry station, where passengers changed trains, or want across to Jacksonville from the Florida East Coast Railway coaches. I still have the little Bible that was given me a souvenir of the first meeting at all Saints.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Mitchell would have the ladies of the Guild meet at her home, and after the business meeting was over she would entertain then by reading from a diary she had kept of a trip to Egypt and up the Nile. Just a few paragraphs at a time, but the reading was continued until the entire trip from start to finish had been covered.</p>
<p>Mr. Will Crawford was the first President of the Florida East Coast. He built a fine home in South Jacksonville, and Mrs. Crawford was as much interested as my mother was in the little Mission of All Saints, and it was these two who started the building. The Florida East Coast gave some money, and the rose memorial window to Mr. Green, an official of the Florida East Coast, was also given by the railroad people.</p>
<p>“The first rector of All Saints was the Rev. Mr. Weller, from Jacksonville, while it was still a Mission of St. Johns.</p>
<p>"The first regular rector after it attained the status of a church was Rev. Mr. Lee. After he loft, we had a splendid little run by the name of Grubb. He was only there for a short time, then we had Mr. Brooke G. White. Then we had a Mr. Hightower. I had by this time become Interested in Christian Science, and Mr. Hightower, being a triot adherent of the letter of the law, told My mother she should take my science books away. Mother replied that as long as I read the Bible, I could worship as I pleased. As I quit All Saints and started attending the Christian Science Church, in Jacksonville, I did not know much about its affairs after that.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Mitchell was very unhappy about David's marriage, and the way it turned out. After there was so much scandal about, Kittie’s carryings on, the divorce, and all, Mrs. Mitchell withdrew more and more from civic church affairs, and lived alone in her big mansion. Her friends were very grateful that she died before the vast fortune was disappointed and went into undeserving hands, and those of schemore and trickrs.</p>
<p>“Mr. Mitchell is buried in the little old St. Nicholas Cemetery on the Southside. Her grave is in about the center of the large plot in the south eastern section, a high round, with a flat marble slab on top. I had memorized the inscription composed by David and which he had carved on the slab - something about 'good deeds live afterwards,  but it escapes me now. However, it is very pretty and very appropriate describing Mrs. Mitchell's acts and charitable inclinations.</p>
<p>“By the way, she was most helpful in carrying on the work and establishing St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville. There was a very elaborate room which she furnished and endowed in St, Luke's, as the  Mitchell Memorial Room'. The first sewing I did as a could was same little doilies of linen which I hemstitched by hand for this room.</p>
<p>“As I said before, my first experience at school was with the little children of Mrs. L. Drew Williams’ Bradford Institute - a private school under the suspices of St. Johns Episcopal Church. After Mrs. William became too feeble to teach, the work was taken over by Mrs. Alice Drew. There were eight girls, among them Kittie Parrott, later Mrs. David Mitchell, and Essen Stuart, of Ft. George Island, later Mrs. Victor Blue.</p>
<p>“When the school dwindled down and was closed, I attended Duval High School, of which Prof. Frederick Pasco was principal.</p>
<p>“After I graduated, I went to Cambridge Institute, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. There I saw snow for the first time, and sat up all night watching the feathery flakes fall into drifts and pile up on the pavements to a depth of twelve inches or more.</p>
<p>“My father, who, as I said had  to Florida for his health in , how became very ill. This was in 1912. I had to return home, and did not get to finish my college course, as father died, and my  had become so worn out in taking care of him during his long illness that she, too, passed away two years later – in 1914.</p>
<p>“One incident I remember at Cambridge was the rise of the famous ,  T. Washington, who was travelling and lecturing in the eastern states raising funds for the Tuskeegee Institute. A young  from New Crlesns, whose name I have forgotten, and I refused to  his lectures, and when other girls were discussing him, we  and leave the room. They called us the ‘two hot-handed the southerasrs.’</p>
<p>“After father died, I started the ‘Booklovers Library’ which was  now at that time in the way of a circulating library. I ran it until the Jacksonville Public Library was opened in its present location in the building which was considered very ornate and upto date at that time – 1904, when Miss Elizabeth Long and I who had  working for several months getting the books ready and maps mounted to hang, went to work there. I stayed there until 1909.</p>
<p>Mr. George B. Utley was the librarian.</p>
<p>“My two brothers, who were born in South Jacksonville, one in 1880 and the other in 1884, had started a Kodak store, handling pictures, handling and developing photographic films, gifts, picture frames, etc., in the building at 24 West Forsyth St., later occupied by Nannally’s Candy Store, and now the home of the Luggage Shop.</p>
<p>“They had built up a fine business, as it was a new line and they had no opposition, but they gave such splendid service they could not help but succeed. Then my oldest brother developed tuberculosis. I took  to the best doctors and finally to a sanatorium in New York. State, where he died. I came back and it was not long before my youngest brother, too, became ill from the dread disease. He seemed stronger, and we sent him to Arizona. The old red house on the Southside, which had been our childhood home was sold, and all the money was devoted to trying to help him make a recovery. He wrote to be brought  as he said Arizona was such a dusty, dry, hot,  place, and it was so lonesome for him. After he returned, he seemed shocred up and was actually better for a few weeks, then one night as I sat near him he said – ‘I am going to die.’ In a few hours he had passed away.</p>
<p>“As one time, Dr. Morris, of Jacksonville, said I, too, would develop tuberculosis – it could not be helped – as I had inherited it the same as my two brothers. But, touch wood  here she smiled, as she touched her desk with her right hand three times – I took up Christian sofence, and I  no vor had a symptom.</p>
<p>“After my second brother died, I ran the store very successfully for several years, taking out enough money to build the little apartment house at 415 East Adams St. I sold the store for a very handsome , and went into the Christian science Reading Room, there I stayed until I was married in 1915.</p>
<p>“During the World War my husband was in the U. S. Naval Service at Savannah, Georgia, I went up there to be near him, and for two years worked in the  office of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.</p>
<p>“After the war we returned to Jacksonville and I went to work in the general office of the Standard Oil Co., being in Mr.  office for ten years.</p>
<p>“In 1932, I came over and had a talk with Mrs. W. W. Cummer, who was at that time president of the Womans Club of Jacksonville, and applied for the position of secretary. We talked at length. The club  had gone down, they were deeply in debt, and Mrs.  would be small to start with, and I would have to be  housekeeper, looking after the physical property of the club,  as handling duties. I told her I was used to hard work, and  to undertake it, and here I am.</p>
<p>“ work I enjoy most thoroughly I am on duty, you might any, twenty-four hours a day, as I have my residence here. This morning I  5:30 and came down and opened up the lower windows – the view from the solarium through the rose beds, the sun rising over the  it was inexpressibly beautiful. The work is varied. I enjoy planning the luncheons and banquets – we have served several of the latter when there were five hundred present. Of course, during the summer months we do not do much, and I am only on half pay, being on active July only on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are open days both to club members and the public.</p>
<p>“My husband travels, and I am alone a great deal, but there is never a dull moment.</p>
<p>“We have two colored regular employees, Lizzie and Jasper, who have been with the club so long their duties are automatic, and they are as much a part of the place as the walls and woodwork. When  affairs, we have to have additional maids and waiters,  during the winter months we have a regular  on  who plans all the  and does the  food. In the  I have to take care of this.</p>
<p>“When I first came with the club in 1932 they had to borrow money  their expenses, and it is gratifying now to know we are  our bonds, and that the funds taken in from  are more than sufficient for all expenses  laying up a bonus. The club now has a roster of  members – and not a dull one in the lot  she finished .</p>
<p> belonging to the Womans Club and the Christian Science  hold membership in local chapters of the Daughters of  Revolution, the Colonial  and the Order of the Eastern Star, America Chapter, so, you see, I am a very busy woman.”</p>
