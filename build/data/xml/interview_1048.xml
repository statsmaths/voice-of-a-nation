<p>January 13, 1939</p>
<p>Hannah Taylor (Negro)</p>
<p>Miami, Florida</p>
<p>(Teacher)</p>
<p>Bertha R. Comstock Writer</p>
<p>HANNAH TAYLOR</p>
<p>A Negro Woman of Outstanding Character</p>
<p>Note: On Friday afternoon, December 9th I made contact with Hannah Taylor and made an appointment to talk with her on the following Monday afternoon, when she was to give me her life story and tell me about several topics of racial interest.</p>
<p>On Saturday, December 10th, she suffered a stroke and died the next day, Sunday, December 11th.</p>
<p>Her daughter (Mrs) Ruth Polite, to whom she gave the instruction: "Finish my work; I have trained you and sister (Edith) and you must carry on," gave me the interview.</p>
<p>The name of Hannah Taylor was given me by K. L. Pharr. Colored undertaker, who said "she is by far the most outstanding woman Miami's colored town has ever had."</p>
<p>The foregoing story is largely from shorthand notes taken as I sat at her in the Frederick school Library. She speaks fluent English, without the least accent or dialect.</p>
