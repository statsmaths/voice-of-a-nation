<p>Mrs. Esther Peter Demos, age 33, is a tall matronly  with shrewd brown eyes and  brown hair, a very friendly and approachable person. She were a raspberry colored shirt and a  silk  dered blouse.</p>

There is a profusion of flowers and  in front of the house which is bordered with a neatly trimed border of artillery plant and a number of large author force on both sides of the ontranco to the screened porch.

The table is spread with a dainty pilot lace cover and there is a  beffet occupying a prominent place near the telephone.'</p>
<p>The walls are finished in rough plaster, heavily enameled in mottled orange and lemon, while the bathroom and kitchen are equipped with all modern conveniences. There are four bedrooms and in the roar of the house there is a two-room cottage which the boys use for a studio when there are guests or when it becomes too noisy in the front home."</p>
<p>As the appointment had been made by telephone, Mrs. Domos talked freely without the aid of questions:</p>
<p>"We have lived in Miami for 14 years. My husband is one of the owners and managers of Topps's Market, 500 N. River Drive. I am a member of the Eastern Star of Carol Cablos and for a while I was one of the officers.</p>
<p>"We have four boys and one girl. Peter, Sr., the oldest, age 80, graduated from Miami High School in 1836, but how he is a student in the University of Miami specializing in engineering in the class of 1948. James Peter, age 18, has a paper route. , age 16, is attending, Miami Senior High School.  age nine, is in the fourth grade at Riverside School. This is Dorothon , only 19 months old.</p>
<p>"My father was one of four brothers who as pioneers built a village near  Laconia. The name means clear water. The reason they were attracted to this place was because there was a very cold spring there fod from a rock in the mountain. Their , or settlement consisted of a church and mall cemetery. Then brother built a beautiful castle and as their children married, other houses were built. The village was beautifully landscaped-with gardens, flowers, fruits and trees. We were able to support a priest who divided his time between our season and his own church at . Our church was named at Nicholas in honor of my grandfather and only our own relatives were buried in the cemetery. As our cemetery was large enough for all. I do not think that any of the bones have ever been removed from the graves.</p>
<p>"I was ten years old in 1912, when I came to America with my mother to join the others of our family who lived in Manchester, new Hampshire. I was too young to work in the factory all the time. So I was sent to school and only worked in the ask  factory during vacation.</p>
<p>"I thought it was so strange when I went to school and road all the Creek myths that my grandmother used to toll me. I used to say: "My grandmother never wrote this book. Now did they get held of my grandmother's stories." I never supposed anybody also ever know them.</p>
<p>"I didn't finish High School,  I not the  I wanted  It was</p>
<p>"My oldest sister was married and lived in  loston, south Carolina. When they came to New York to visit my cousin before coming on to Manchester, they brought three  nice  along with then from New York. They all tried to got nominated with me, but if didn't take me long to select the one I liked best.</p>
<p>"My sister called no aside and asked no which one I wanted and  the called Mr. Domos aside and told him that I had  him. He was very happy, because he felt the same way about it. So you see, that was as good as an engagement. He promised to correspondent and got married  years later when I would have finished High School, but we changed our  and got married in tem months. I could have had a big wedding, but I did not want it."</p>
<p>Mr. Domos is a strong looking,  of an athletic type while his shiny black hair, stiff heavy eye brows and broad  emphasize his dark, snappy eyes get in deep sockets. He was freshly shaved and definitions in appearance, his loving attentions to his wife and baby just us to was  for  revealed  at  of the home.</p>
<p>"My cousin  but along with her husband. Before their , they were so attached to each other and for a while alter  married until  them  apart. There was a woman who as jealous of my cousin and n't want them to be happy.</p>
<p>"All at ones, they discovered that they  not bear each other. They could sit in a room together and cry and cry and  ever now happy they used to be. They tried to find out what was the matter with them. Finally the husband :</p>
<p>"I believe that oalous woman has done this. Do you suppose she has worked on use"</p>
<p>"They watched her and found  what she had done. I don't round or what it was, but cross she told lies about then. Anyhow, they were able to  what she had done and  as happy an over.</p>
<p>"When we lived in Manchester. I heard so many stories of the Evil Eye and with craft that I was afraid to turn around or go into a dark room. I was so narvour and fearful ever the stories that my mother  my father and brothers to lot no hear any  of then.  after I was married and  tell the stories that I know never  would get an  as ever. So I made up  that my children  out them.</p>
<p>"How, this really happened in Greece when my father was a your . There was a young  said: 'I don't believe any of your  stuff, I am not afraid to go to a comotery at midnight and I'll prove it to you.'</p>
<p>"So it was agreed that he should take a , sward and thrust it up to the  on a grave and core back home again. Then in the morning they would go to the comotery and find the award as he had left it.</p>
<p>"The victim were a tunic shirt that spread ever the grave as he  over and thrust the award through the skirt, not knowing that to had  himself to the grave.</p>
<p>"So it happened, that when he started to go back home, he felt something pulling and holding him fast. He was so frightened that he died on the spot and his scoffers grieved ever their folly, when they fo him the next  and could see that he had made a desperate struggle to free himself from the ."</p>
