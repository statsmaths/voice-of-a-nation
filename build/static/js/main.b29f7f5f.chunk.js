The desire to identify and address the problems of the South came as the institution of higher education aspired to become a national research university and thought leader on the region, which was signaled by two increasingly prestigious  institutional units: UNC Press and the Institute for Research in Social Sciences (IRSS). William \u201cBill\u201d Couch, who took the reins of UNC Press in 1925 and became Director in 1932, published work that did not shy away from addressing the region\u2019s problems in turn demonstrating that reflexive, critical scholarship could come from within the region."}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"We then turn to how the stakes of the debate about how to represent the South heightened with the Great Depression, which placed the American South under a microscope. The region\u2019s economic precarity combined with a culture of segregation further cemented the region\u2019s reputation as anti-modern, backwards, and impervious to progress; questions about the region\u2019s fitness for full inclusion and citizenship abounded. How to assess and represent the challenges of the region became a central concern. Two warring schools of intellectual thought framed the academic and literary representations of the South. The Agrarians, based at Vanderbilt University, romanticized a return to White rural, folk culture arguing sociological scholarship aided in the erosion of Southern traditional values. Howard Odum and his UNC-Chapel Hill colleagues, on the other hand, advocated for systematic, scientific studies of the region through fieldwork conducted by experts so that solutions to social problems could be identified. The evidence constructed a region that was distinct due to its regional culture but also a part of modernity and therefore the nation, earning them a reputation as advocates for \u201cthe New South\u201d. These debates did not only play out in the academic and literary marketplace, but within the federal government as well."}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"Next we reveal the critical role the federal government played in launching the SLHP.

While Couch and Odum worked closely together as UNC Press regularly pushed work by Odum\u2019s IRSS Institute, Couch questioned if the academic prose driven by statistics that was becoming the norm for Sociology could communicate the challenges of the region to scholarly and popular audiences. He worried that such writing less accurately represented the actual lives of those being documented. With the support of the FWP\u2019s Director Henry Alberg, Couch officially launched the life histories project upon being named the FWP\u2019s Regional Director of the Southeastern region in 1938. With one foot in the federal government, which lent him the authority to pursue his new approach to documenting social conditions, and one foot in academia, as the director of the South\u2019s most prominent press, Couch built the SLHP. "}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"We then turn to the aims of the SLHP. The method of \u201clife histories\u201d was an intentional intervention in debates about what counted as sociological knowledge during the era. Debates over how to capture and document social life abounded \u2014whether through numbers and statistics in sociology, ethnographies from anthropology, first-hand stories through folklore, or through the increasingly broad category of \u201cdocumentary.\u201d  Couch conceptualized \u201clife histories\u201d as a more authentic form of documentation that amplified the voice of the interviewee. By recording these memories in the form of life histories, the project created a new method of collecting evidence about past and present social conditions by giving the people who were the subject of the sociological gaze of academics and the New Deal state a voice in the process rather than privileging sociological experts\u2019 statistics or reducing their lives to romanticized folkways through folklore. Through narratives that emphasized qualitative rather than quantitative ways of knowing, readers could then more accurately and realistically access individuals\u2019 experiences, which in turn served as a gateway to larger truths about Southern society.

Writers, most of whom were White women, were sent out to different locations with an outline to follow when conducting interviews. However, they were given permission to diverge from the outline when necessary, because \u201cthe stories will not be usable if they are constructed on a rigid pattern,\u201d Couch argued.

With the help of an interactive map, we show the ways in which these life histories were ensconced in stories of place\u2014a distinctly Southern space that Couch believed would help a national readership re-imagine Southern laborers as perceptive about their conditions, hard-working, and shaped by the past as well as the present rather than defined by stereotypes of the region as uneducated, lazy, and backwards.

Couch sought to use these place-based stories to challenge stereotypes of the region as socially and culturally regressive in order to position the South as a productive contributor to American society and therefore a benefit to the nation.

Moreover, the mapped data reveals that interviewers primarily visited small towns and rural areas, albeit only those surrounding metropolitan centers, which evidences Couch\u2019s desire to raise the status of the rural South and the laborers within what he saw as exploitative systems such as mill work and tenant farming. Efforts to elevate the rural South came at a time of great anxiety that industrialization and migration were destroying local rural culture. The life histories sought to show how rural life was still foundational to Southern social life and identity rather than position these communities as economically and socially behind the times. While such an effort could have been the Agrarian\u2019s dream, the life histories were not designed to romanticize agrarian labor but rather demonstrated the ways that the tenant farming system exploited laborers and served as a critique of industrial capitalism. "}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"We conclude by looking at how writers engaged with interviewees. Labeled by scholars as the \u201cdocumentary decade,\u201d the 1930s was a period in which cultural workers experimented with forms of documentary representation. As Farm Security Administration photographers such as Dorothea Lange pointed her camera at migrant farmers, life history writers such as Bernice Harris wrote the stories of tenant farmers. SLHP writers spent hours in people's homes chronicling their interviewee's lived experiences tasked with instructions from Couch that required them to write stories that would be \u201cphotographic in accuracy.\u201d However, the instructions simultaneously demanded that writers should maintain authenticity by making sure the stories were simply told with interviewees speaking for themselves. These seemingly contradictory instructions that demanded the writers\u2019 detached narrator description and at the same time the interviewee\u2019s own voice were executed by writers with varying skill levels, proclivity for genres as well as personal prejudices. The result was uneven texts that give as much and likely more insight into the subjectivity of the writers than the subjectivity of the interviewees. We draw on scholars of the ethnographic and documentary encounter to explain how these interactions were an active, real-time negotiation that was shaped and reshaped by the positionality and subjectivity of the interviewer and interviewee. "}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"While seldom acknowledged, our data demonstrates that women were in fact central to the project. At a time when women were often relegated to the domestic sphere, the SLHP employed over ten women who set out across the South to record people\u2019s stories. Their employment was not only a part of a shift in labor practices that would accelerate during World War II but aligned with the ideals, albeit rarely fully realized, of New Deal liberalism. The interviewers sought women\u2019s stories guaranteeing representation in the documentary record and therefore inclusion into the national documentary record. Women discussed a range of themes such as domestic life and labor. Because of their gendered positionality, they also had unique access as women spoke with a level of candor reserved for those who they perceived as sharing a similar experience and sensibility. As a result, interviewees broached issues such as domestic abuse and prostitution offering a rare glimpse into taboo topics that shaped women\u2019s daily lives, often as societal open secrets but culturally silenced. Moreover, this same positionality perceived as less threatening also resulted in women writers being sent to interviewee communities in marginalized positions including African Americans as well as immigrant classes that were not yet read as fully White. As a result, the vast majority of the life histories were written by women. While the SLHP offered some possibilities for new writers to enter the workforce, others were foreclosed.
