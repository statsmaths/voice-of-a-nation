The first layer of our digital manuscript explains why and how the Southern Life History Project came into formation. It situates the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an epicenter of debates about how to create sociological knowledge through efforts to identify and address the problems of the South during the 1920s and 1930s. It then recovers the political and cultural history that facilitated the creation of the Southern Life History Project (SLHP) as a project of the Federal Writers’ Project under UNC Press Editor William “Bill” Couch.

The 1920s and 1930s cemented the University of North Carolina as a center of social science about the region at a time when the South was under a microscope for its economic precarity and social order. The desire to identify and address the problems of the South came as the institution of higher education aspired to become a national research university and thought leader on the region, which was signaled by two increasingly prestigious  institutional units: University of North Carolina Press (UNC Press) and the Institute for Research in Social Sciences (IRSS). William “Bill” Couch, who took the reigns of UNC Press in 1925 and became Director in 1932, published work that did not shy away from addressing the region’s problems in turn demonstrating that reflexive, critical scholarship could come from within the region.

The layer then turns to how the stakes of the debate about how to represent the South heighted with the Great Depression, which placed the American South under a microscope. The region’s economic precarity combined with a culture of segregation further cemented the region’s reputation as anti-modern, backwards, and impervious to progress; questions about the regions fitness for full inclusion and citizenship abounded. How to assess and represent the challenges of the region became a central concern. Two warring schools of intellectual thought framed the academic and literary representations of the South. The Agrarians, based at Vanderbilt University, romanticized a return to white rural, folk culture arguing sociological scholarship aided in the erosion of Southern traditional values. Howard Odum and his UNC-Chapel Hill colleagues, on the other hand, advocated for systematic, scientific studies of the region through fieldwork conducted by experts so that solutions to social problems could be identified. The evidence constructed a region that was distinct due to its regional culture but also a part of modernity and therefore the nation, earning them a reputation as advocates for “the New South”. These debates did not only play out in the academic and literary marketplace, but within the federal government as well.

The layer ends by revealing the critical role the federal government played in launching the Southern Life History Project. Part employment project and part laudatory experiment in federal support of cultural work, New Deal agencies such as the  Federal Writers’ Projects (FWP) pursued documentary projects and entered the fore over how to document and communicate the “real” conditions of people in the U.S.  Who should be documented, how they should be documented, and why they should be documented were key questions that animated the New Deal as well as Couch and Odum. While Couch and Odum worked closely together as UNC Press regularly pushed work by Odum’s IRSS Institute, Couch questioned if the academic prose driven by statistics that was becoming the norm for Sociology could communicate the challenges of the region to scholarly and popular audiences much less accurately represent the actual lives of those being documented.
