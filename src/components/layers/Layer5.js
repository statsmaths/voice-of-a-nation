In the conclusion we unite the close archival analysis of Layers 1 and 2, the spatial analysis of Layer 3, and the textual analysis of Layer 4 to reflect on the legacies of the SLHP. Pulling together each of the Layers, we show how and why the project attempted to shape cultural memory and the telling of history. By placing the oral histories as a novel, alternative method of social documentation, we place the work of the SLHP within the long history of grappling with what “counts” as social knowledge, how to accurately represent social conditions, who could produce such knowledge, and who is and is not represented.
